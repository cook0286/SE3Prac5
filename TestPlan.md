TestPlan for SE3Prac5 2048
============================================

Introduction
---------------

The purpose of this document is a Testing Plan for 2048 program for SE3 practicals.

The basic premise of the 2048 game is that you tilt the board left, right, up or down to move numbered tile together.  Any numbers that match, are combined into a single tile with the sum of the values of the two original tiles.  Since only pairs of tiles combine, the values will always be powers of two.  Each time you tilt the board, one new tile with value 2 or 4 is added.  The challenge is to work up to having a tile with 2,048 on it, before the board fills and no move is possible.  The score is calculated as the sum of the number on all tiles that have been combined.  


This documentment will be divided into sections; Section 1 is this section. Section 2 describes the required sources to perform the testing. Section 3 Features to be tested. Section 4 Features that will not be tested. Section 5 List of documents that will be produced during the testing process. Section 6 will describe the risks and dependencies. Finally Section 7 will cover the success criteria of the test.
